# Minotaur

## Prerequisites

_Minotaur_ is written for Linux systems using miniLibX as graphic libraries.
It is actually not ported on any other systems.

To compile and run this program in Linux, you will need to satisfy the dependencies MiniLibX requires (`xorg`, `libext-dev`, `zlib1g-dev`) running:

`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xorg libxext-dev zlib1g-dev libbsd-dev
`

## Build Process

To build the project, navigate to the root directory of the repository and run the following command: `make all`.

After compilation has been completed, you can execute the program in 2 gamemodes:

1. `./minotaur` will start an instance of _Minotaur_ with player and minotaur at the default starting positions
2. `./minotaur random` will additionally randomize the coordinates of the characters

## Next steps

1. Implement alternative maze generation algorithms
2. Add items and enrich game mechanics to empower playability
3. Try varying number of enemies and penalties for getting caught
4. Bind a key to a `save_map()` function that saves the current map grid.
5. Keep track of movement history
6. Add a collectibles that allows player to see the best exit path until next move
