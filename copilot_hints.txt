To convert the XPM image to an array of RGB values, you'll need to parse the XPM data. The first few lines of the XPM data define the color palette, where each character is mapped to a color. The rest of the lines represent the pixels of the image, where each character refers to a color in the palette.

Here's a simple function that does this:

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct {
    unsigned char r, g, b;
} RGB;

RGB* xpm_to_rgb(char* xpm[], int width, int height, int colors) {
    RGB* rgb_image = malloc(width * height * sizeof(RGB));
    RGB palette[256] = {0};

    // Parse color palette
    for (int i = 0; i < colors; i++) {
        char color_char = xpm[i+4][0];
        unsigned int color;
        sscanf(xpm[i+4] + 5, "#%06X", &color);
        palette[(unsigned char)color_char] = (RGB) {
            .r = color >> 16,
            .g = (color >> 8) & 0xFF,
            .b = color & 0xFF
        };
    }

    // Parse image data
    for (int y = 0; y < height; y++) {
        for (int x = 0; x < width; x++) {
            char pixel_char = xpm[y+colors+4][x];
            rgb_image[y*width + x] = palette[(unsigned char)pixel_char];
        }
    }

    return rgb_image;
}

This function first parses the color palette from the XPM data and stores it in the palette array. Then it goes through the image data and converts each character to an RGB value using the palette.

You can use this function like this:

int main() {
    RGB* rgb_image = xpm_to_rgb(explorer_xpm, 16, 16, 16);
    // Now rgb_image is an array of RGB values representing the image
    free(rgb_image);  // Don't forget to free the memory when you're done
    return 0;
}

Please note that this function assumes that the XPM data is in a specific format, where each color is represented by a single character and the color code is a 6-digit hexadecimal number. If your XPM data is in a different format, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.

The first line of the XPM data after the array declaration contains the width, height, number of colors, and characters per pixel. In your case, this line is "16 16 16 1", which means the image is 16 pixels wide, 16 pixels high, uses 16 colors, and each pixel is represented by 1 character.

You can extract these values with the sscanf function in C. Here's how you can do it:

int width, height, colors, cpp;
sscanf(explorer_xpm[0], "%d %d %d %d", &width, &height, &colors, &cpp);

printf("Width: %d, Height: %d, Colors: %d, Characters per pixel: %d\n", width, height, colors, cpp);

This code reads the first line of the XPM data and extracts the four integers. It then prints these values. You can replace the printf line with whatever you want to do with these values.

Please note that this code assumes that the XPM data is correctly formatted. If the first line of the XPM data does not contain four integers, sscanf will not be able to extract them and the values of width, height, colors, and cpp will be undefined.

To read the explorer_xpm array from the explorer.xpm file, you can use file I/O functions in C. However, please note that the explorer.xpm file is a C source file, not a standard XPM image file. Standard XPM files are plain text files that can be read line by line, but C source files contain additional syntax (like static char * explorer_xpm[] = {) that needs to be parsed.

Here's a simple way to read the explorer.xpm array from the explorer.xpm file:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_LINES 1000
#define MAX_LINE_LENGTH 100

char** read_xpm_array(const char* filename) {
    FILE* file = fopen(filename, "r");
    if (!file) {
        printf("Error: Could not open file %s\n", filename);
        return NULL;
    }

    char** xpm_array = malloc(MAX_LINES * sizeof(char*));
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_LINES; i++) {
        xpm_array[i] = malloc(MAX_LINE_LENGTH * sizeof(char));
    }

    char line[MAX_LINE_LENGTH];
    int line_count = 0;
    while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), file)) {
        if (strstr(line, "{") || strstr(line, "};")) {
            continue;  // Skip lines with { or };
        }
        strcpy(xpm_array[line_count++], line);
    }

    fclose(file);
    return xpm_array;
}

int main() {
    char** explorer_xpm = read_xpm_array("explorer.xpm");
    // Now explorer_xpm is an array of strings read from the file
    // Don't forget to free the memory when you're done
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_LINES; i++) {
        free(explorer_xpm[i]);
    }
    free(explorer_xpm);
    return 0;
}

This code reads the explorer.xpm file line by line and stores each line in the xpm_array. It skips lines that contain { or };, which are part of the C syntax and not part of the XPM data.

Please note that this code assumes that the explorer.xpm file does not contain more than MAX_LINES lines and each line is not longer than MAX_LINE_LENGTH characters. If your file is larger, you may need to increase these values.
